My name is Megan and I'm a third year computer science major. I am originally from Charleston, but I have lived in multiple states and now reside in Gumbranch, GA. A fun fact about me is that I am distantly related to Kelly McGillis, the female lead in Top Gun. Trying new places to eat around Charleston is always fun. I also love spending time outside, learning new things, bike riding, and being creative. I look forward to working with my team and learning in CSCI 462 this semester!
