Hi my name is Tyler Tracy and I am a senior at the College of Charleston. I am majoring in Computer Information and Systems and look forward to graduating this spring. I am from Columbia, SC so I am not too far away from home. I have a golden retriever that is just over a year old. I spend a lot of my free time in Charleston with her and my friends doing things downtown or at the beach.}
